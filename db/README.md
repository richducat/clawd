# db/

This repo directory tracks schema/migration sources for local SQLite databases.

Databases are stored in the local Google Drive sync folder for durability:

`~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-richducat@gmail.com/My Drive/OpenClaw Databases/`

Scripts should use that location (via env var `OPENCLAW_DB_ROOT`), not commit DB files to git.

## Hybrid DB standard (roadmap item #2)

Canonical DB file:
- `hybrid-core.sqlite`

Migrations:
- `db/migrations/*.sql` (ordered by filename)
- Applied migration records are stored in the DB table `schema_migrations`.

Bootstrap command:
```bash
npm run db:hybrid:init
```

This command:
- Creates the DB directory if needed.
- Opens/creates `hybrid-core.sqlite`.
- Applies unapplied migration files transactionally.
- Enforces checksum consistency for previously-applied migrations.

Current baseline schema includes:
- `entities` for canonical CRM/KB/Ops records
- `entity_chunks` for chunked text and embedding vectors (stored as JSON arrays)
- `entity_links` for typed relations between entities
